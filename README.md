Hi! I'm Steffi LaZerte, an independent biological consultant and R programmer, and part time Community Assistant at [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org).

I provide services in **R programming**, **R instruction**, **data management/cleaning**, and **data analysis**. 
If you are interested in any of these services, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:sel@steffilazerte.ca), or check out [my website](https://steffilazerte.ca) for more details.

**Package Development**   
I take pride in developing R packages that are not only powerful but user-friendly, including informative errors and checking, in-depth tutorials, and instructions. See a [full list of my R packages](https://steffilazerte.ca/R.html).

**Teaching**  
The learning curve for R is fairly steep to start out. I aim to help reduce this learning curve by explaining R in ways that make sense to non-programmers. I also help explain workflows and general best-practices. There is so much more to R than simply statistics. I teach through formal classes/lectures, workshops, group tutoring, and informal one-on-one tutoring, remote or locally.

**Data management**  
I also specialize in managing, preparing and analyzing large and complex data sets used in the fields of environmental monitoring, conservation, ecology, behaviour, evolution, and other natural sciences. As a biologist specializing in behavioural ecology I also have the training to consider experimental and statistical protocols, biological relevance and other necessary considerations when preparing data for analysis.
